# Princeton-Algorithms

Cousera online course, [Introduction to Algorithms][1], created by Princeton
University.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs
to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and
scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers
elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses
on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
